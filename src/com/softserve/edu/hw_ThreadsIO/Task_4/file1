Hello, my name is Dmytro.
I was born on 03.09.2003 in the village of Veryn, Lviv region.
I am a beginner Java Programmer.
I'm studying in Lviv Polytechnic National University.
Actually, this is not the best choice to study programming.
We study only old languages and old technologies.
So I decide to start learning Java because this language is the most popular,
and it's like C++ I studied.
I am currently studying at Softserve IT Academy and I am very happy.
